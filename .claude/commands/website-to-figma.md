# /website-to-figma - Capture a Website into Figma

Capture a live website into a Figma file using Figma MCP, with an optional follow-up to create design system variables and styles.

**IMPORTANT:** For full implementation details, also read `.claude/agents/website-to-figma.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Website URL

Ask the user:

**What website URL would you like to capture into Figma?**

Example: `https://linear.app` or `https://stripe.com`

### Step 2: Start Bridge Server & Verify Plugin

Start the bridge server in background:

```bash
cd bridge-server && pnpm dev &
```

Poll `http://localhost:4001/health` until responsive.

Remind user: **Please open the Figma plugin: Plugins → Development → Bridge to Fig**

Send `ping` command to verify plugin connection. If no response after 15 seconds, prompt user again.

### Step 3: Get File Key from Figma

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "getFileInfo", "payload": {}}'
```

Poll result — extract `fileKey` from the response.

### Step 4: Initiate Figma MCP Capture

Call the `generate_figma_design` MCP tool:
- `outputMode: "existingFile"`
- `fileKey`: from Step 3

This returns a JavaScript capture snippet and a `captureId`.

### Step 5: Run Capture via Playwright

1. Use Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` to open the website URL
2. Use Playwright MCP `browser_evaluate` to execute the JS capture snippet returned from Step 4
3. No manual user action required — Playwright handles it automatically

### Step 6: Poll for Completion

Call `generate_figma_design` again with the `captureId` from Step 4 to poll for completion.

The website is now captured in the Figma file.

### Step 7: Ask About Design System

Ask the user:

**Do you want to create design system variables and styles from this website?**

- **Yes** — Continue to Step 8
- **No** — Skip to Step 9

### Step 8: Create Design System (Optional)

**8a: Ask organizing principle preference:**
- 4-Level Hierarchy (Default) — Primitive → Semantic → Tokens → Theme
- 3-Level Simplified — Primitives → Tokens → Theme
- 2-Level Flat — Primitives → Tokens
- Material Design 3 — Reference → System → Component
- Tailwind CSS Style — Colors → Semantic

**8b: Extract design tokens:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "extractWebsiteCSS", "payload": {"url": "USER_URL"}}'
```

Poll result with extended timeout (300000ms).

**8b.1: Check theme direction:**
The result includes `cssVariables` with automatic theme mode detection.
- `cssVariables.rootMode` — whether `:root` is `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"unknown"`
- `cssVariables.variables` — CSS custom properties with `.light` and `.dark` values already mapped correctly

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT assume `:root` = light. Use `cssVariables.variables[name].light` and `.dark` directly for Token variable creation.

**8c: Classify brand colors:**
1. Filter neutrals (saturation < 10%)
2. Sort remaining by saturation × frequency
3. Present top 3 as Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

**Detected brand colors from {URL}:**
- Primary: `#XXXXXX` (most vibrant, {count} uses)
- Secondary: `#XXXXXX` ({count} uses)
- Tertiary: `#XXXXXX` ({count} uses)

Ask: **Is this mapping correct, or would you like to adjust?**

**8d: Create design system:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "createDesignSystem",
    "payload": {
      "brandColors": {
        "primary": "#CONFIRMED_PRIMARY",
        "secondary": "#CONFIRMED_SECONDARY",
        "tertiary": "#CONFIRMED_TERTIARY"
      },
      "organizingPrinciple": "USER_SELECTED",
      "includeBoilerplate": true,
      "createTypographyStyles": true,
      "createEffectStyles": true,
      "primaryFontFamily": "EXTRACTED_FONT"
    }
  }'
```

Report created variables and styles.

**8e: Bind typography styles to captured nodes:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "applyMatchingTextStyles", "payload": {"scope": "page", "forceRestyle": true, "snapToNearest": true}}'
```

This automatically matches each text node on the page to the closest typography style by font size. Reports exact matches vs snapped (nearest) matches.

### Step 9: Report Results

```
Website Capture Complete!
=========================

Source: {url}
Figma file: {fileKey}

Capture: Website captured via Figma MCP
Design System: {N variables created / skipped}

Next steps:
1. Review the captured page in Figma
2. Adjust any elements as needed
```

### Step 10: Shutdown Server

Kill the background bridge server process.

## Prerequisites

- Bridge server available (`pnpm dev` from bridge-server/)
- Figma plugin installed and connectable (needed for `getFileInfo`)
- Figma MCP server connected (for `generate_figma_design`)
- Playwright MCP available (for browser automation)
- Internet connection
