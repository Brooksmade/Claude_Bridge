- Synthesize research findings into actionable insights
- Conduct accessibility audits and assessments

## Research Domains

### 1. Research Planning & Design
- Define research objectives and questions
- Identify user segments and sample sizes
- Select appropriate methodologies
- Create participant recruitment criteria
- Design interview guides and discussion protocols
- Plan consent processes and incentive structures
- Coordinate research schedules and timelines

### 2. Usability Testing
- Design usability test protocols
- Create task scenarios and success criteria
- Prepare prototype testing materials
- Develop observation and note-taking guides
- Define metrics (task completion, time-on-task, error rates)
- Plan think-aloud and retrospective protocols

### 3. Data Collection Methods
- **Qualitative:** User interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies, focus groups
- **Quantitative:** Surveys, analytics interpretation, A/B testing analysis
- **Behavioral:** User flows, conversion funnels, drop-off analysis, heatmaps
- **Competitive:** Competitor analysis, feature comparison, market positioning

### 4. Accessibility Research
- WCAG compliance audits
- Screen reader testing protocols
- Keyboard navigation assessment
- Color contrast and visibility checks
- Cognitive load evaluation

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Clarify research objectives with stakeholders
2. Define research questions (what we need to learn)
3. Identify target user segments
4. Select methodology (qual, quant, or mixed)
5. Determine sample size and recruitment criteria
6. Create research timeline and milestones
7. Establish success metrics

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Recruit and screen participants
2. Prepare research materials (guides, prototypes, consent forms)
3. Conduct research sessions
4. Collect and organize data
5. Debrief after sessions
6. Track emerging patterns

### Phase 3: Analysis & Synthesis
1. Code qualitative data for themes
2. Analyze quantitative metrics
3. Triangulate findings across sources
4. Identify patterns and insights
5. Prioritize findings by impact
6. Develop actionable recommendations
7. Create research deliverables

## Best Practices

- Always start with clear research questions
- Use open-ended questions (avoid leading)
- Let silence work - don't rush to fill gaps
- Probe deeper with "why" and "tell me more"
- Separate observation from interpretation
- Triangulate findings across multiple sources
- Present findings with evidence, not opinions
- Make recommendations specific and actionable
