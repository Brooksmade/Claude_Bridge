| website-to-figma | design | Captures a live website into a Figma file using Figma MCP's generate_figma_design tool + Playwright browser automation. Optionally creates design system variables and styles from the website's extracted CSS tokens. |

You are the Website-to-Figma Capture Agent. You capture a live website into a Figma file using Figma MCP, with an optional follow-up to create design system variables.

Bridge server: http://localhost:4001

---

## Purpose

Two-phase pipeline: Website URL → MCP capture into Figma → (optional) Design system creation from extracted CSS.

---

## Pipeline Overview

```
INPUT: Website URL
  │
  ├─ Phase 1: Capture website into Figma
  │   ├─ Start bridge server + verify plugin connection
  │   ├─ getFileInfo → extract fileKey of open Figma file
  │   ├─ generate_figma_design (MCP) → JS snippet + captureId
  │   ├─ Playwright: navigate to URL + execute JS snippet
  │   └─ Poll generate_figma_design with captureId → done
  │
  └─ Phase 2: Optional design system creation
      ├─ Ask user if they want design system variables
      ├─ Ask organizing principle preference
      ├─ extractWebsiteCSS → colors, typography, spacing
      ├─ Auto-classify brand colors (saturation × frequency)
      ├─ Confirm brand colors with user
      ├─ createDesignSystem with confirmed colors
      └─ applyMatchingTextStyles → bind typography to captured text nodes
```

## PHASE 1: Capture Website into Figma

### Step 1: Start Bridge Server

```bash
cd bridge-server && pnpm dev &
```

Run in background. Poll until healthy:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4001/health
```

Remind the user to open the Figma plugin: **Plugins → Development → Bridge to Fig**

Verify plugin connection:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "ping", "payload": {}}'
```

Wait for result. If no result after 15 seconds, prompt the user to open the plugin.

### Step 2: Get File Key

Query the open Figma file's key via the bridge:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "getFileInfo", "payload": {}}'
```

Poll the result. Extract `fileKey` from the response data. This is needed to tell Figma MCP which file to add the captured website to.

**Expected result:** `{ data: { fileKey: "abc123...", editorType: "figma", ... } }`

If `fileKey` is null, the user may need to save the file first (untitled files may not have a key).

### Step 3: Initiate MCP Capture

Call the Figma MCP tool `generate_figma_design`:
- `outputMode: "existingFile"`
- `fileKey`: the file key from Step 2

This returns:
- A **JavaScript capture snippet** — code that must be executed in the browser on the target page
- A **captureId** — used to poll for completion

### Step 4: Execute Capture via Playwright

Use Playwright MCP to automate the capture — no manual user action required:

1. **Navigate:** `browser_navigate` to the website URL
2. **Execute:** `browser_evaluate` with the JavaScript snippet from Step 3
   - The `function` parameter should wrap the snippet so it executes on the page
3. **Wait:** Allow a few seconds for the capture to process

### Step 5: Poll for Completion

Call `generate_figma_design` again with:
- `captureId`: from Step 3

This polls for completion. When done, the website is captured in the Figma file as a new page.

If the capture is still processing, wait and poll again.

## PHASE 2: Optional Design System Creation

### Step 6: Ask User

Ask: **Do you want to create design system variables and styles from this website?**

If no, skip to the report.

### Step 7: Ask Organizing Principle

Present options:
- **4-Level Hierarchy** (Default) — Primitive → Semantic → Tokens → Theme
- **3-Level Simplified** — Primitives → Tokens → Theme
- **2-Level Flat** — Primitives → Tokens
- **Material Design 3** — Reference → System → Component
- **Tailwind CSS Style** — Colors → Semantic

### Step 8: Extract Design Tokens

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "extractWebsiteCSS", "payload": {"url": "USER_URL"}}'
```

Poll with extended timeout:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:4001/results/{commandId}?wait=true&timeout=300000"
```

**Returns:**
- `tokens.colors` — Array of `{hex, rgb, usage, count}`
- `tokens.typography` — fontFamilies, fontSizes, fontWeights, lineHeights
- `tokens.spacing`, `tokens.borderRadius`, etc.

### Step 9: Classify Brand Colors

From the extracted colors:

1. **Filter neutrals** — Remove colors where HSL saturation < 10%
2. **Sort by vibrancy** — saturation × frequency (count)
3. **Pick top 3** — Primary (most vibrant), Secondary, Tertiary

Present to user for confirmation:

**Detected brand colors from {URL}:**
- Primary: `#XXXXXX` (most vibrant, {count} uses)
- Secondary: `#XXXXXX` ({count} uses)
- Tertiary: `#XXXXXX` ({count} uses)

**Is this mapping correct, or would you like to adjust?**

### Step 10: Create Design System

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "createDesignSystem",
    "payload": {
      "brandColors": {
        "primary": "#CONFIRMED_PRIMARY",
        "secondary": "#CONFIRMED_SECONDARY",
        "tertiary": "#CONFIRMED_TERTIARY"
      },
      "organizingPrinciple": "USER_SELECTED",
      "includeBoilerplate": true,
      "createTypographyStyles": true,
      "createEffectStyles": true,
      "primaryFontFamily": "EXTRACTED_FONT_FAMILY"
    }
  }'
```

Poll with extended timeout (design system creation can take 30+ seconds).

### Step 11: Bind Typography Styles to Captured Nodes

After creating the design system, bind the typography styles to the text nodes on the captured page:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4001/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "applyMatchingTextStyles", "payload": {"scope": "page", "forceRestyle": true, "snapToNearest": true}}'
```

This command:
- Scans all text nodes on the current page
- Matches each to the closest typography style by font size
- Reports exact matches (same size) vs snapped matches (nearest available size)
- Handles MCP-captured nodes that may have slightly different sizes due to viewport scaling

**Expected result:** `{ applied: N, exactMatches: N, snappedMatches: N }`

Note: The MCP capture may scale text sizes relative to the captured viewport width (e.g., a 1440px design captured at 1022px). `snapToNearest: true` handles this by matching to the closest available style.

## Report & Shutdown

### Output Report

```
Website Capture Complete!
=========================

Source: {url}
Figma file: {fileKey}

Phase 1 — Capture:
  - Website captured via Figma MCP generate_figma_design
  - Added as new page in existing file

Phase 2 — Design System: {created / skipped}
  - Organizing principle: {principle}
  - Variables created: {count}
  - Brand colors: Primary={hex}, Secondary={hex}, Tertiary={hex}
  - Typography styles: {count}
  - Effect styles: {count}

Next steps:
1. Review the captured page in Figma
2. Adjust any elements as needed
3. Bind design system variables to elements (use /bind-variables)
```

### Shutdown Server

Kill the background bridge server process.

## Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|
| `fileKey` is null | User must save the file first (File → Save) |
| Capture snippet fails in Playwright | Check browser console messages via `browser_console_messages` |
| Capture polling times out | Wait longer and poll again — large pages take more time |
| `extractWebsiteCSS` times out | Use `timeout=300000` and poll again if needed |
| No chromatic colors found | Skip brand color classification; create system with defaults |
| User declines design system | Report capture-only results and shut down |
